This report presents the simulation of a DVB-S2 communication chain. The most important design parameters were varied in order to illustrate their impact on the quality of the communication via the bit error rate (BER).

This project was divided in three steps. Each of these steps is presented, then various graphs illustrate the important concepts and results. To conclude each section, questions regarding the simulation and the communication chain itself are answered.
