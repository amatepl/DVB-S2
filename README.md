MATLAB implementation of DVB-S2 communication system.

# DVB-S2
The Digital Video Broadcasting-Satellite (DVB-S) standard, released in 1993, specifies the communication for the broadcasting of television to the homes. It is based on quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation and convolutional forward error correction (FEC). To better answer the ever-increasing demand for capacity required by the new user applications, a second generation of satellite broadband communication systems has been specified in 2003 (DVB-S2). DVB-S2 not only targets the broadcasting of standard definition and high definition television but also the support of interactive services including internet access. Note however that DVB-S2 only specifies the forward link.The Digital Video Broadcasting-Satellite (DVB-S) standard, released in 1993, specifies the communication for the broadcasting of television to the homes.
